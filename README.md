<h2>I'm Eduardo Vaz!</h2>

- I'm 19 years old

- I'm from Paran√°, Brazil üáßüá∑ but I live in S√£o Paulo

- I'm currently studying Computer Science at [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/)

- I love developing and studying algorithms, am really interested in Machine Learning and Game Developing, and enjoy Back-End developing way more than Front-End


- I'm a fluent Python üêç programmer, as it was my first programming language

- fluent Java ‚òï programmer, with it being my favorite language for Back-End developing

- I'm a fluent C programmer, having developed many algorithms and studied various Data Structures with it

- I was a competitor at [RoboCup 2023: Bordeaux](https://www.robocup.org/), in the Rescue RMRC category, as a pilot for [Insper Dynamics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insper-dynamics/?viewAsMember=true)

- I have developed many REST web services, with Django , Flask and more frequently, Spring Boot

- I have tinkered a lot with Artificial Inteligence, and I'm currently studying Machine Learning


<h1> About My Projects and Skills üß†</h1>

My profile mainly contains college and personal projects, many of which I've developed with my friends

Some interesting Projects to get started in knowing more about my skills are:

<h2> RoboCup 2023: Bordeaux</h2>

In the 2023 [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/) I was a pilot for [Insper Dynamics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insper-dynamics/?viewAsMember=true), in the Rescue RMRC category, where we represented Insper and Brazil üáßüá∑.



<h2> Cuida Heli√≥polis </h2>

Cuida Heli√≥polis was a social development project I developed with my friends at college. 
It is a web service designed with the intent to connect mothers and caretakers in partnership with [UNAS](https://www.unas.org.br/), a charitable organization from the community of Heli√≥polis.


More information about it can be found at the Project's Repository: [Cuida Heli√≥polis](https://github.com/Isabelleatt/Cuida-Heliopolis-Backend)

<h3>Skills Used and Developed in this Project</h3>

- Java ‚òï Fluency, with it being my favorite language for Back-End developing

- Developed with the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) Framework

<h2> Linear Algebra Projects</h2>

Some of the projects I'm proudest of are the projects me and my friend [Jo√£o Lucas](https://github.com/JoaoLucasMBC) developed during ou Linear Algebra studies at college.
All of these prjects have way more detailed explanations of their development in their respective repositories.

Some of them include:

- [The Hanged Man](https://github.com/EduardoMVAz/The_Hanged_Man): The Hanged Man is an algorithm developed using concepts such as <b>The Huffman Tree</b> and <b>Entropy</b> to try to win the Hangman game with a high accuracy.
 
- [Netflix Challenge](https://github.com/EduardoMVAz/Netflix_Challenge): Netflix Challenge is a project we developed using <b> Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors </b> and a bunch of <b>Data Analysis</b> to try to predict the rating a user would give to a series or movie it hasn't watched based on the ratings the user has already given to movies.

- [2023: A Birds Odyssey](https://github.com/EduardoMVAz/2023_a_birds_odyssey): 2023: A Birds Odyssey is a pygame project developed with many techniques used in game development, such as vectorial distance and aceleration, and was a pretty fun project!

<h3>Skills Used and Developed in these Projects</h3>

- Python üêç fluency and Extensive OOP

- Complex Linear Algebra Concepts
